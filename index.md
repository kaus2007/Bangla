Etymology Main article: Names of Bangla

The name of Bangla is derived from the ancient kingdom of Banga,(pronounced Bôngô) the earliest records of which date back to the Mahabharata epic in the first millennium BCE. Theories on the origin of the term Banga point to the Proto-Dravidian Bong tribe that settled in the area circa 1000 BCE and the Austric word Bong (Sun-god). The term Vangaladesa is used to describe the region in 11th-century South Indian records.The modern term Bangla is prominent from the 14th century, which saw the establishment of the Sultanate of Bengal, whose first ruler Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah was known as the Shah of Bangala. The Portuguese referred to the region as Bengala in the Age of Discovery.

The modern English name Bengal is an exonym derived from the Bengal Sultanate period. Bengal (/bɛŋˈɡɔːl/;[4] Bengali: Bānglā/Bôngô, pronounced [ˈbɔŋgo] (About this soundlisten)) is a geopolitical, cultural and historical region in South Asia, specifically in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent at the apex of the Bay of Bengal, predominantly covering present-day Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal. Geographically, it is made up by the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta system, the largest such formation in the world, along with mountains in its north bordering the Himalayan states of Nepal and Bhutan, and east bordering Myanmar.

Politically, Bengal is divided into Bangladesh to the east and the Indian state of West Bengal. The native population in Indian West Bengal are known as "Ghoti", while native population in Bangladesh are known as "Bangal".

In the past, at the time of the Bengal Sultanate and colonial period, this area included the states of modern- day Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Assam, Tripura, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Nagaland, and Manipur in India, and some parts of Myanmar (Rakhine State).[5][6] In 2011, the population of Bengal was estimated to be 250 million,[1] making it one of the most densely populated regions in the world.[5] Among them, an estimated 160 million people live in Bangladesh and 91.3 million people live in West Bengal. The predominant ethnolinguistic group is the Bengali people, who speak the Indo-Aryan Bengali language. Bengali Muslims are the majority in Bangladesh, and Bengali Hindus are the majority in West Bengal. (The area was divided during Partition.)

Outside this region, the Indian state of Tripura and Assam's Barak Valley have a Bengali-majority population, which also has a significant presence in the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Uttarakhand.[7]

Dense woodlands, including hilly rainforests, cover Bengal's northern and eastern areas; while an elevated forested plateau covers its central area. Highest elevation point of this region is Sandakphu (3636 m; 11,930 ft), located in the Darjeeling district of West Bengal. In the littoral southwest are the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest and home of the Bengal tiger. In the coastal southeast lies Cox's Bazar, the longest beach in the world at 125 km (78 mi).[8] The region has a monsoon climate, which the Bengali calendar divides into six seasons.

At times an independent regional empire, Bengal was a leading power in South Asia and later the Islamic East, with extensive trade networks. In antiquity, its kingdoms were known as seafaring nations. Bengal was known to the Greeks as Gangaridai, notable for mighty military power. It was rescribed by Greek historians that Alexander the Great withdrew from India because he anticipated a counterattack from an alliance of Gangaridai.[9] Later writers noted merchant shipping links between Bengal and Roman Egypt. The Bengali Pala Empire was the last major Buddhist imperial power in the subcontinent,[10] founded in 750 CE and becoming the dominant power in the northern Indian subcontinent by the 9th century CE.[11][12] It was replaced by the Hindu Sena dynasty in the 12th century.[10]

Islam was introduced during the Pala Empire, through trade with the Abbasid Caliphate.[13] Following the formation of the Delhi Sultanate in the 13th century, Islam spread across the Bengal region. During the Islamic Bengal Sultanate, founded in 1352, Bengal was a major trading nation in the world and was often referred to by Europeans as the richest country to trade with.[14] The Khorasanis referred to the land as an "inferno full of gifts", due to its unbearable climate but abundance of wealth.[15]

It was later absorbed into the Mughal Empire in 1576. Bengal Subah, described as the Paradise of the Nations,[16] was the empire's wealthiest province, and became a major global exporter,[17][18][19] a center of worldwide industries such as cotton textiles, silk,[20] and shipbuilding.[21] Its economy was worth 12% of the world's GDP,[22][23][24] a value bigger than the entirety of Western Europe, and its citizens' living standards were among the world's highest.[25][22] Bengal's economy underwent a period of proto-industrialization during this period.[26]

The region was conquered by the British East India Company after the Battle of Plassey in 1757, and it was defined as the Bengal Presidency of the British Raj. Bengal made significant contributions to the world's first Industrial Revolution, but later suffered its own deindustrialisation.[27] The East India Company increased agriculture tax rates from 10% to up to 50%, which caused famines such as the Great Bengal famine of 1770. This resulted in the deaths of 10 million Bengalis.

Bengal played a major role in the Indian independence movement, in which revolutionary groups were dominant. Armed attempts to overthrow the British Raj began with the Sannyasi and Fakir Rebellion, and reached a climax when Subhas Chandra Bose led the Indian National Army allied with Japan to fight against the British. Many Bengalis died in the independence struggle, and many were exiled in the Cellular Jail, located in Andaman. The United Kingdom Cabinet Mission of 1946 split the region between India and Pakistan, an action popularly known as the partition of Bengal (1947), dividing the area between predominately Muslim and Hindu populations. This action was opposed by both the Prime Minister of Bengal, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, and nationalist leader Sarat Chandra Bose. They campaigned for a united and independent nation-state of Bengal. The initiative failed owing to goals of British diplomacy and communal conflict between Muslims and Hindus.[note 1] Subsequently, Pakistan ruled East Bengal, which in 1971 became the independent nation of Bangladesh by the Bangladesh War of Independence that year.
